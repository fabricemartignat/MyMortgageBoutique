### Purpose

MyMortgageBoutique is a virtual platform designed to cater to High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) seeking bespoke mortgage solutions. Our website offers a comprehensive suite of services including browsing mortgage products, simulating loan amounts against property collateral, and exploring case studies. These features collectively highlight MyMortgageBoutique's capability to address the unique financial needs and circumstances of UHNW clients, whether it's funding a new property purchase, releasing equity, or refinancing an existing mortgage.

### Inspiration

The genesis of MyMortgageBoutique is rooted in my professional journey within the credit sector, specifically my role as a Credit Advisor at a Private Bank. There, I've had the privilege of structuring mortgage deals for HNW individuals, a complex and nuanced task that requires a deep understanding of their unique financial landscapes. This experience has not only honed my expertise but also inspired me to create a platform that makes these specialized services accessible to a wider audience of HNWIs.
